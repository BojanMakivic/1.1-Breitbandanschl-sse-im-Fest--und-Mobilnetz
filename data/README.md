Place the Excel file you want to publish here as:

- data/data.xlsx

This is used by the GitHub Pages export script (`npm.cmd run build:pages`) to generate `docs/data.json`.

Important: GitHub Pages cannot read your local drive, so the data must be committed to the repo (or fetched from a public URL).
